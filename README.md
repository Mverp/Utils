# Utils
The Utils package is my base package for programming Fiji plugins aimed at cell-biology image analysis.

It contains subjects like:
- Data structures
- Visualization both in image as in graphs
- Often used mathematical operations
- Often used measurement techniques

This package uses the following dependencies:
- The [ImageJ](https://imagej.net) IJ package
- The [JFreeChart](http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/) package of JFree.org
- The [JUnit](http://junit.org/junit4/) test package
